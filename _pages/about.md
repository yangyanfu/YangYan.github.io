I am currently a postdoctoral researcher of the Institute for Chinese Studies at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Prior to joining FU, I served as a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, from 2021 to 2023, concurrently holding the position of Assistant Research Fellow at the Institute for Contemporary China Studies at Tsinghua University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2021, along with a Bachelor's degree in Management Studies in 2015.

My research focuses on public administration, public policy, and authoritarian politics, with a particular emphasis on China. Specific research topics include China's cadre system and elite politics, agenda setting and policy attention, environmental politics, and digital authoritarianism. My current research projects involve examining China's ongoing digital transformation from the perspectives of state capacity and a decentralized authoritarian system. I pay special attention to the policy narratives and underlying motivations of digital strategies at a local level. Additionally, I am conducting research on the changing public image of local political elites of the Chinese Communist Party.

My research findings have been or will be published in academic journals such as the Journal of Contemporary China, Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis, Administration & Society, and China: An International Journal.
